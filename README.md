  # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Project Description

I built this project during my Bootcamp pre-work assignment to help prepare me for upcoming classes. It's main purpose is to help improve my front-end development skills by applying beginner HTML, CSS, and Javascript elements to form a simple website intended to be used as a study guide. This project marked my first experience with coding, where I learned about repositories, GitHub, Git Bash, VS Code, and other essential tools I hadnâ€™t used before. It also taught me the importance of writing clean, structured code to ensure everything functions correctly.
